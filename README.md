# >_bug-hunting
Repository to submit my scripts and the way I hunt

# >_Who I am
Hey guys, y'all can call me "pad1" or "ryoshi" or "pad1ryoshi" and I'm a hacker from Brazil.

# >_Offensive Security and Bug Hunter
I love offensive cybersecurity and I'm constantly learning. I plan to become a excellent bug bounty hunter - maybe one of the best - and fulfil my dreams and goals.

# >_This repository
This repository will serve as a way to showcase my scripts - using existing tools - in bash in order to automate some processes. I prefer to do processes manually but I realize the importance of automation for some tanks.

I hope it develops well! Everything will be done in shellscript.
