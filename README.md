# >_bug-hunting
Repository that will be used to show my automation scripts for some processes when hunting for bugs.


## >_This repository
This repository will serve as a way to showcase my scripts - using existing tools - in bash in order to automate some processes. I prefer to do processes manually but I realize the importance of automation for some tasks.
