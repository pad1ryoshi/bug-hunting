# >_bug-hunting
Repository that will be used to show my automation scripts for some processes when hunting for bugs.


## >_Who I am | Offensive Security and Bug Hunter
Hey guys, y'all can call me "pad1" or "ryoshi" or "pad1ryoshi" and I'm a aspiring hacker from Brazil. I love offensive cybersecurity and I'm constantly learning. I plan to become a excellent bug bounty hunter - maybe one of the best - and fulfil my dreams and goals.


## >_This repository
This repository will serve as a way to showcase my scripts - using existing tools - in bash in order to automate some processes. I prefer to do processes manually but I realize the importance of automation for some tanks.
